In late stage testing... code, plans and demo vids will be released soon

BTRS- Introducing the first ...Wireless, Individually Addressable, Portable, Reactive... Racing Drone Circuit &amp; Gaming System.  Designed by a hobbyist who like most, grew up on consoles and movies :)

So I love racing drones... the flying, the building, the meets with so many like minded people. 
The thing is, I've always felt like something is missing... 
We grew up on things like Mario Kart, Top Gun & Wipeout... Big Bright Lights, Explosions, Speed Boosts... Weapons!!!
They bring a level of fun & excitement that is way beyond a typical drive/fly round a track.

I've wanted to do this for a couple of years now but had never learnt to code, thing is I work in IT and that's kind of important. 
Therefore I decided to kill two birds with one stone and go for it over the winter. 

The System is designed to be ultra cheap to make, and uses common components, it comprises of...

A main controller to run your racing world, buttons for inputs and a serial interface for I/O to/from your PC or android.
Numerous receiver units, 1 for each gate, weapon or background lights.
Gates, fitted with led strip.
Laser gates... gates with lasers... what else?
Weapon gates of all varieties, Fans for speed boosts, or slow downs, Nerf Guns, you name it... If you can trigger it with a relay, mosfet or servo. You can fire it remotely, or automatically through use of additional laser gates.
Lighting reacts to music, sound effects can be triggered.
Aside from the standard races (if you can call them that) Games and sequences can be coded.
Currently, chase the gate is on and working well... think the bleep test at school, but around a track and you don't want to puke afterwards.

This has been built to be scalable, perfect for tiny whoop'ing, or full scale brushless, its probably even perfect for other racing hobbies... but who cares about them... quads rule!

I've tested range and when I've actually managed to chop good antennas (please note.. tape measures are not ideal when chopping antennas) The range has comfortably been at up to 70 meters but could probably go further.

Coders, builders...There Is still lots that could be done with the system, winter is coming to an end and soon I wont have the time to keep slogging through it... I'll be flying while screaming obscenities at my opponents, in an environment reminiscent of a 90's rave :)

Please help out where you can.

5.8 tracking is top of the list, this would enable things like race timing, and games like capture the flag, capture the course, or even just giving an alternate means to collect weapons. Carlito has been working real hard over the last weekend to develop a 5.8ghz CTF receiver & has kindly offered to help try and incorporate it, however we could always use assistance in getting things like the scanning and switching times down, and managing the data coming back... which could also be used to do some really cool things.

It also needs more games. It's been setup that coding the controller to act as a score unit would be pretty simple, scores can be read out, sounds play, interfaces for digital media could be setup...

The possibilities really are endless, 
build it, mod it, film it and maybe send me a link so i can see what you've managed to do with it.
